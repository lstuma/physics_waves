# Physics and Waves?
Extremely simplistic 2D Wave simulation

## What is this?
I literally don't know but I'll hand this to my physics teacher anyways

## How do I use it???
Just run wavy.py in console using python

## What you can do with this
You can create snapshots of a physical system at an arbitrary point in time with as many 2-dimensional waves as you want!
